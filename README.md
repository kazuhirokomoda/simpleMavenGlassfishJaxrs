simpleMavenGlassfishJaxrs
======================
This is a sample Java application.

Continuous Integration (CI)
- Automated build
- Automated test

Inspired by this blog post (https://programmaticponderings.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/continuous-integration-and-deployment-using-git-maven-jenkins-and-glassfish/),
> Build an automated deployment pipeline for your Java EE applications using leading open-source technologies, including NetBeans, Git, Maven, JUnit, Jenkins, and GlassFish.
> The three main goals of our deployment pipeline will be continuous integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment. Our objective is to automatically compile, test, assemble, and deploy our Java EE application to multiple environments, as the project progresses through the software development life cycle (SDLC).
